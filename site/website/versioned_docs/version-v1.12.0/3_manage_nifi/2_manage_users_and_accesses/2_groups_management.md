To simplify the access management Apache NiFi allows to define groups containing a list of users, on which we apply a list of access policies.
This part is supported by the operator using the `NifiUserGroup` resource:


```yaml
apiVersion: nifi.konpyutaika.com/v1
kind: NifiUserGroup
metadata:
  name: group-test
spec:
  # Contains the reference to the NifiCluster with the one the registry client is linked.
  clusterRef:
    name: nc
    namespace: nifikop
  # contains the list of reference to NifiUsers that are part to the group.
  usersRef:
    - name: nc-0-node.nc-headless.nifikop.svc.cluster.local
#     namespace: nifikop
    - name: nc-controller.nifikop.mgt.cluster.local
  # defines the list of access policies that will be granted to the group.
  accessPolicies:
      # defines the kind of access policy, could be "global" or "component".
    - type: global
      # defines the kind of action that will be granted, could be "read" or "write"
      action: read
      # resource defines the kind of resource targeted by this access policies, please refer to the following page:
      #	https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/administration-guide.html#access-policies
      resource: /counters
#      # componentType is used if the type is "component", it's allow to define the kind of component on which is the
#      # access policy
#      componentType: "process-groups"
#      # componentId is used if the type is "component", it's allow to define the id of the component on which is the
#      # access policy
#      componentId: ""
```

When you create a `NifiUserGroup` resource, the operator will create and manage a group named `${resource namespace}-${resource name}` in Nifi.
To declare the users that are part of this group, you just have to declare them in the [NifiUserGroup.UsersRef](../../5_references/6_nifi_usergroup#userreference) field.

:::important
The [NifiUserGroup.UsersRef](../../5_references/6_nifi_usergroup#userreference) requires to declare the name and namespace of a `NifiUser` resource, so it is previously required to declare the resource.

It's required to create the resource even if the user is already declared in NiFi Cluster (In that case the operator will just sync the kubernetes resource).
:::

Like for `NifiUser` you can declare a list of [AccessPolicies](../../5_references/2_nifi_user#accesspolicy) to give a list of access to your user.

In the example above we are giving to users `nc-0-node.nc-headless.nifikop.svc.cluster.local` and `nc-controller.nifikop.mgt.cluster.local` the right to view the counters information.
