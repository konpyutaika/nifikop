Apache NiFi is a good candidate to create an operator, because everything is made to orchestrate it through REST Api calls. With this comes automation of actions such as scaling, following all required steps: https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/administration-guide.html#decommission-nodes.

Enable the NiFi cluster to be scaled by HPA kubernetes feature:

- upscale cluster (add a new Node)
- downscale cluster (remove a Node)

### Seamless Istio mesh support

- Operator allows to use ClusterIP services instead of Headless, which still works better in case of Service meshes.
- To avoid too early nifi initialization, which might lead to unready sidecar container. The operator will use a small script to
mitigate this behaviour. All NiFi image can be used the only one requirement is an available **wget** command.
- To access a NiFi cluster which runs inside the mesh. Operator will supports creating Istio ingress gateways.
