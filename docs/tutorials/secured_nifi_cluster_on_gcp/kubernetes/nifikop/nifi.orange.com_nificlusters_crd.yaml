              description: oneNifiNodePerNode if set to true every nifi node is started
                on a new node, if there is not enough node to do that it will stay
                in pending state. If set to false the operator also tries to schedule
                the nifi node to a unique node but if the node number is insufficient
                the nifi node will be scheduled to a node where a nifi node is already
                running.
