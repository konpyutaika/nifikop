                              is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created
                              before the pod starts, and deleted when the pod is removed.
                              \n Use this if: a) the volume is only needed while the
                              pod runs, b) features of normal volumes like restoring

                              the documentation of the driver for more information.

                                          all values, and generates an error if a
                                          disallowed value is specified. (Beta) Using

                                  objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is

                                              types of objects, DataSourceRef allows
                                              any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                              objects. * While DataSource ignores
                                              disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
                                              preserves all values, and generates
                                              an error if a disallowed value is specified.

                                      from which to populate the volume with data,
                                      if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be
                                      any local object from a non-empty API group
                                      (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      object. When this field is specified, volume
                                      binding will only succeed if the type of the
                                      specified object matches some installed volume
                                      populator or dynamic provisioner. This field
                                      will replace the functionality of the DataSource
                                      field and as such if both fields are non-empty,
                                      they must have the same value. For backwards
                                      compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef)
                                      will be set to the same value automatically
                                      if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                      There are two important differences between
                                      DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource
                                      only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is specified. (Beta) Using this field
                                      requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                                      to be enabled.'

                        treats \"global minimum\" as 0, and then the calculation of

                        won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If

                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global

                        the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed
