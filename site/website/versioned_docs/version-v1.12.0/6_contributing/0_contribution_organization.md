## New ownership for more community oriented

The NiFiKop operator was originally started by Orange in March 2020 as [Orange-OpenSource/nifikop](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/nifikop), 
and then forked as `konpyutaika/nifikop` in March 2022: but this is the same codebase and the same developers.

We made this decision in concert with Orange team, because some legal restrictions would not have allowed to involve and serve external community around this operator efficiently.
Therefore,we have chosen to fork the source code into another organization and repository, which will allow a more open ownership and community-oriented development.

It is important to notice that Orange will still continue to work and contribute to the operator, but as part of the community ðŸ˜„.

## Organizations

With this ownership move, we decided to set up a new project management, with the aims to be more and more community-oriented

### Slack channel

One of the most important topics we want to improve is probably the communication around the operator's development. 
To achieve this, we have created a new Slack open to anyone who wants [to join](https://join.slack.com/t/konpytika/shared_invite/zt-14md072lv-Jr8mqYoeUrqzfZF~YGUpXA),
with two main channels:

- [#nifikop-news](https://konpytika.slack.com/archives/C035FHN1MNG): There we will announce each new release, and communicate about next objectives for the operator.
- [#nifikop-discussion](https://konpytika.slack.com/archives/C035X6KP684): Direct discussion between each member of the community to design new needs, fix issues and help each other.

### Tech scoping

As we want to involve as much as possible the people on the operator, we will introduce a new support for brainstorming and designing new major features.

This is the Tech Scoping, whose main objective is to describe the problem statement that we are trying to solve, 
the different approaches that could solve it, and together discuss and challenge them to define the solution to be implemented.

You can find all the tech scoping in this [Google Drive repository](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-A__UxEdRBZrwEUJu4lMF4LJtIstrnT0?usp=sharing)
